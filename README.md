# rust-mangakakalot

Author: [@alexng353](https://github.com/alexng353)

## Todo

- add support for chapmanganato.com

### Usage

```bash
./rust-mangakakalot <URL>
```

### disclaimer

Only been tested with one manga so far (devilchi, 118ch)

I MADE IT SLOW ON PURPOSE.

The delay is 500ms between images and 3s between chapters so you don't get instantly banned from mangakakalot.

Also, you can just go change the values in the file if you want since you're probably building from source because of how lazy I am
